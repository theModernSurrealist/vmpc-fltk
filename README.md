# vmpc-fltk, an FLTK implementation of VMPC2000XL, the Akai MPC2000XL emulator

## This is still very WIP!
## Instructions for compiling an executable are at izzyreal/vmpc-juce

This implementation consists of only the screen portion of the MPC - it is controlled by keyboard shortcuts/MIDI.
Settings will be modified from a configuration script.
